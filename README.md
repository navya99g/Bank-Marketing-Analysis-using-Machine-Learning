# Bank Marketing Campaign Analysis using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing bank marketing campaign data to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit. Machine learning classification models are used to understand customer behavior and improve campaign targeting strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset contains customer demographic, campaign-related, and economic indicators collected from direct marketing campaigns.
- Target variable: **y** (Term deposit subscription: Yes/No)
- The dataset is included in this repository for learning and demonstration purposes.

## Project Objectives
- Analyze customer behavior across demographic and campaign features  
- Identify key factors influencing term deposit subscription  
- Build and evaluate machine learning classification models  

## Approach
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature engineering  
4. Model building and evaluation  
5. Interpretation of results and insights  

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree Classifier  

## Evaluation Metrics
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-score  
- Confusion Matrix  

## Tools & Technologies
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

## Key Insights
- Campaign-related features such as contact frequency and previous outcomes significantly influence subscription behavior  
- Class imbalance impacts model performance and requires careful metric selection
